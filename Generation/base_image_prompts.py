# Base image generation prompt
BASE_IMAGE_PROMPT = "Wide-angle photorealistic action shot capturing a stunningly beautiful young woman with a strong, athletic physique performing a weighted squat in the middle of a spacious, brightly lit, modern gym floor. Frame the shot as far away as possible, ensuring ample space around the subject to clearly show a significant amount of the surrounding environment: include visible weight racks, benches, other diverse gym equipment, and the general architecture of the expansive facility in the background. She displays focus and determination. She wears well-fitting, grey high-performance athletic leggings and a matching grey sports bra suited for intense workouts. Dynamic lighting illuminates both her muscular form and the detailed gym setting. Sharp focus on the subject with clear background context, hyperrealistic details, 8K resolution."

# Negative prompt to avoid unwanted elements
BASE_IMAGE_NEGATIVE_PROMPT = "ugly, deformed, blurry, low quality, extra limbs, disfigured, poorly drawn face, bad anatomy, cartoon, drawing, illustration, text, watermark, signature, multiple people."
